# Card_Counter
A simple solution to learn card counting.

<p>
Built in HTML, using css, js, jquery and php<br/>
Watched 21 last night, so decided to write a program to allow people to learn how to do it.
</p>
<p>
20190603 - Initial Build - Allows user to select how many cards are dealt as well as dealer speed<br/>
Dealer speeds start at 1 card every 3 seconds all the way to 4 cards a second.
</p>
<p>
TODO:<br/>
Allow user to hide the count.<br/>
Allow user to take next 2 cards after counting.<br/>
Allow user to select how many players at table.
</p>
