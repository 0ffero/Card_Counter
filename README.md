# Card_Counter
A simple solution to learn card counting.

Built in HTML, using css, js, jquery and php
Watched 21 last night, so decided to write a program to allow people to learn how to do it.

20190603 - Initial Build - Allows user to select how many cards are dealt as well as dealer speed
Dealer speeds start at 1 card every 3 seconds all the way to 4 cards a second.

TODO:
Allow user to hide the count
Allow user to take next 2 cards after counting.
Allow user to select how many players at table.
